- create performance test case step

1.  mock a new simple user in database.
2.  get the user from database.

- test getUser service
- for other service need user

3.  get the real question from database
4.  mock the function that submit a question with answers to be estimated
5.  check the user performance

6.  get ramdon questions haven't been submitted
7.  get the fail questions with answers

- that is the reasonable test flow
